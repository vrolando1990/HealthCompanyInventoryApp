# MedSupplyInventory

We are a group of 3 that decided to create a medical inventory app as our semester-long project. This app functions as an equipment request and inventory holder. In our initial phase, we implement a Singly-LinkedList "database" in which each node holds an equipment object to take advantage of the insertion and deletion speed O(1). This project is ongoing.

## Getting Started

Currenly this program runs on any C++ IDE such as Visual Studio or CodeLite.
